# Contributing

We're glad you're interested in contributing to this project.

This repository functions a little differently than some others. We value your ideas and suggestions for improvement, but we **currently don't accept pull requests** (PRs).

Here's how you can contribute in a way that best suits this project:

* **Issues:** Report any bugs you encounter. A detailed description of the bug and steps to reproduce it will be incredibly helpful.
* **Discussions:** Share your ideas for new features or improvements. Explain the problem you're trying to solve with your suggestion and the potential benefits it would bring. 

**Important Note:**

* The implementation of suggestions ultimately rests with the repository owner. This allows us to maintain project focus and ensure changes align with the overall vision.
* While we may not be able to implement every suggestion, we will carefully consider each one.

We appreciate your understanding and look forward to your contributions in the form of insightful suggestions and well-defined issues.

# Contributing

I'm happy you're interested in contributing to this project!

This repository works a bit differently than some others. I value your ideas and suggestions for improvement, but  currently **don't accept pull requests** (PRs).

Here's how you can contribute in the most helpful way:

- **Issues**: Let me know if you encounter any bugs. A detailed description of the bug and steps to reproduce it will be incredibly helpful.
- **Suggestions**: Share your ideas for new features or improvements! Explain the problem you're trying to solve with your suggestion and the potential benefits it would bring.

**Important Note**:

While I may not be able to implement every suggestion, I will carefully consider each one.
